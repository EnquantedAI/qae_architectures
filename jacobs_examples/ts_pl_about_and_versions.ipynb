    "**Aims:**\n",
    "> The goal of this series of notebooks is to build a Time Series Quantum Autoencoder,<br>\n",
    "> a circuit which can compress a quantum state of a time series onto a smaller amount of qubits,<br>\n",
    "> while retaining the information from the initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:** The QAE solution was inspired by the \"Qiskit Tutorial 12\"\n",
    "- Time series data was converted to a series of sliding windows.\n",
    "- Several approaches to TS data encoding were tested, i.e. unary, binary and anglular.\n",
    "- Angle encoding was eventually used, with values centered around H state, in the range of [0+m..1-m]\n",
    "- The model featuring an input and encoder blocks only (optional swap test) was subsequently trained.\n",
    "- For testing, and the circuit was initialised with an optimum set of parameters from training.\n",
    "- Each test sample was then encoded into the QAE circuit, which was executed using a state vector simulation.\n",
    "- State vectors of input and output data was then visualised and compared. \n",
