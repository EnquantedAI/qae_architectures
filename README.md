## QAE Architectures in PennyLane+PyTorch

### Aims
*Investigation of quantum autoencoder architectures for effective denoising of signal and time series.*

### Current work
*Explore this repository and its files*
- Investigate ways to implement encoder and decoder in PennyLane.
- As we all may end up having slightly different projects (to be discussed),
  at this stage keep your draft work in your separate folders.

### Folders
*We'll need some common utilities, I suggest to keep them as .py files in a directory.*
- utils: which is a collection of Python files and testing notebooks to manage QAEs, plots and quantum circuits
